        At Darsoon, we prioritize the protection of children&apos;s privacy. To ensure their safety, our services are not
        intended for individuals under the age of 18, unless they have obtained explicit permission from their parents
        or legal guardian. If you are under 18, you must seek your parent&apos;s or legal guardian&apos;s consent before sharing
        any personal information with us. In cases where we do process personal data of children under 18, it is only
        with the consent of their parent or legal guardian for the sole purpose of using our services. We do not
        knowingly collect information from minors. We urge parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&apos;s
        internet usage and to guide them in adhering to our Privacy Policy by not sharing any information on our website
        without their permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we come to know that we have unintentionally collected personal information of a minor, we will make efforts
        to remove that information from our database. If parents suspect that we have collected any information related
        to their child, they can ask us to delete it.

        services. We may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties for research or marketing purposes.
