Learning Roadmaps are common in software enginering, Since they are so many subjects and mini-subject to learn (or have an idea about). 

A Learning Roadmap gives you a big picture and all things you need to learn. 

But also it might give you some opinions about where to start and and in what order learn things. Depending on the author of roadmap and its user, this might be a good thing or not.

I generally don't like to give a more flexible tool. So, I remove "the order" from the learning roadmap and make it a learning map.

Initally I wanted to call it learning checklist, but actually it's not intrisnicy a checklist, since you don't need to learn and check all the items.

It's a map. Like a city map. A learner is like a tourist, and decides which places to visit and in what order. 

In the following posts I will share my learning maps for HTML, CSS, JS, UI design, and so many cool stuff.
