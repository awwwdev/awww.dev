```html
<html>
  <head> 
    ...
  </head>
<body>
  <header />
  <nav id='primary' >
    ...
  </nav>
  <main >
    ...
  </main>
    <footer >
      ...
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notes: 

* You can have multiple nav in a page, and when you have, you need to add id to them.
* Don't put main <nav> in the `<header/>`. Otherwise users with sceenreaders can't find it unless they check into the `<header/>`
