This is a list to review check if you have learned all the HTML essentials, or if there are some gaps you need to fill. It's not learning roadmap to tell you where to start first.

```html
<html>
  <head> 
    ...
  </head>
<body>
  <header />
  <nav id='primary' >
    ...
  </nav>
  <main >
    ...
  </main>
    <footer >
      ...
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notes: 

* You can have multiple nav in a page, and when you have, you need to add id to them.
* Don't put main <nav> in the `<header/>`. Otherwise users with sceenreaders can't find it unless they check into the `<header/>`
