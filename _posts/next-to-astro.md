I migrated a Next.js website to Astro. Here is a how it went!

<figure>
<!-- <video src='/next-to-astro.mp4' class='rd-xl b-1 shadow-xl block'  controls playsinline muted autoplay /> -->

<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/824922485?h=a31e725f50&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="next-to-astro"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
</figure>

The video is a 5 hours process with 100x speed.

This was my third of fourth time I went through this. It is fun since, it's involves more deleting codes, than adding. And then you need to find some creative ways to handle interactive functionalities.

If you are planning to create a blog or portfolio Astro is the tool you need.

<div class=!my-20>
<a href='https://astro.build' class='bf-i-logos-astro-icon before:opacity-100 btn-ghost no-underline inlin-flex ac  mt-10 py-4 px-8 af-i-ph-arrow-up-right after:mis-6'>Astro Website</a>
</div>

Update: Now this portfolio has been move to Astro, too!
