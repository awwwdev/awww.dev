I migrated a Next.js website to Astro. Here is a how it went!

The video is a 5 hours process with 100x speed.

This was my third of fourth time I went through Next-to-Astro migration. It is fun since, it's involves more deleting codes, than adding. And then you need to find some creative ways to handle interactive functionalities.

If you are planning to create a blog or portfolio Astro is the tool you need. [Check out their cool website](https://astro.build).
