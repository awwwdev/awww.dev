          <p>I help businesses create user experiences that give them a competitive edge.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, I've worked with various teams as both a Developer and Designer.</p>
          <p>
            As a developer, I build everything from complex web applications to landing pages with bold designs,
            ensuring top performance and accessibility. While I specialize in front-end development, I also design data
            structures, set up REST APIs, and create backend applications using modern web technologies like tRPC,
            PostgreSQL, and Node.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a designer, I collaborate with teams to define their visual identity, create wireframes, and develop
            high-fidelity UI prototypes ready for development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, photography, and playing music. I'm always excited to explore new ways to combine art and web technologies.
