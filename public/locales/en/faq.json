  "q1": "What is Darsoon?",
  "a1": "Darsoon is a marketplace for private online tutoring. We provide a medium where tutors can present themselves through their profile's pages, and learners can select their preferred tutors.",
  "q2": "Who are the founders of Darsoon?",
  "a2": "We are a few families living in Toronto, Canada who have created this website. We took online classes for our children during the pandemic and realized how useful these classes are. Even though these classes were online and remote, they were even better than in-person classes in several aspects. That's why we decided to create this website so that more people can take advantage of these services.",
  "q3": "How do you screen the tutors?",
  "a3": "The first group of the tutors are those who have been our own or our children's tutors and we were very satisfied with their qualifications and teaching skills. We now have a very robust selection process, where we review the resumes, and interview selected candidates. Once they pass all our criteria, they are added to the website.",
  "q4": "How do I find a tutor and take lessons in Darsoon?",
  "a4": "You first select your preferred tutor on the Darsoon website and complete the introductory meeting request form. We will give your contact information to the tutor and ask him/her to contact you to schedule the introductory meeting. The tutor may contact you by WhatsApp or email. In the introductory meeting, which is free and lasts around 15 minutes, you and the tutor will talk about your expectations and the teaching method. Once you both agree that there is a perfect match, you can go ahead and make payments on the tutor's profile page on Darsoon website. The cost listed on the website is for when you purchase the 5 or 12-session package. If you purchase a single-session package the cost is 15% higher, whereas you receive a 5% discount if you purchase a 20-session package. You can schedule your sessions directly with the tutor once you make the payment.",
  "q5": "What age group is Darsoon for?",
  "a5": "Darsoon's learners include children of five years of age and above to adults and seniors. On each tutor's profile page, you can see what age group the lessons are suitable for. After you select a tutor for your children, you can also make sure that the lessons are suitable for them during the introductory session.",
  "q6": "What are the cancellation rules?",
  "a6": "You can change the time of your class up to 24 hours before the start of the class by contacting the tutor and coordinating with him/her.",
  "q7": "How should I pay for the lessons?",
  "a7": "You can pay online by credit card using the secure Square gateway on our website. On the Payment page, you can select the package you would like to purchase, and then make the payment. If you are a resident of Canada, you can also pay by e-transfer. Please contact us if you would like to use this method of payment.",
  "q8": "How do you set the price of the lessons?",
  "a8": "The price of the lessons is set by the tutors. Darsoon only provides a price range which is the same for the tutors who teach a subject.",
  "q9": "Can I coordinate with my tutor and pay the lesson fee directly to him/her?",
  "a9": "Direct payment to the tutors is not permitted as it creates accounting problems for Darsoon.",
  "q10": "Which video platform is used to hold the lessons?",
  "a10": "Tutors and learners can agree on their platform of choice. Darsoon recommends Skype or Google Meet.",
  "q11": "Can I record the sessions for myself?",
  "a11": "No. Neither the tutor nor the learner is allowed to record the sessions.",
  "q12": "The subject I'm looking for doesn't exist on Darsoon's website. What can I do?",
  "a12": "We would appreciate it if you let us know through the Contact Us page. We try to add new subjects regularly based on our learners' requests.",
  "q13": "The duration of the session on the tutor's profile page is one hour, but I prefer half-hour sessions. What can I do?",
  "a13": "You can discuss this issue with the tutor in the introductory meeting and mutually agree on changing the duration of the session. The cost of the lesson will be adjusted proportionally.",
  "q14": "Is it possible to hold semi-private lessons with more than one learner?",
  "a14": "You can discuss this issue with the tutor during the introductory meeting. The cost will increase by 20% for each additional learner.",
  "q15": "Is there an evaluation session before starting the lessons? Is it possible for me to speak with the tutor to make sure the lesson is a fit for my needs?",
  "a15": "Yes. The introductory meeting is free and lasts for 15 minutes so that you can make sure that the lesson is suitable. In this meeting, the tutor can also do an evaluation and determine your level.",
  "q16": "Can the price of lessons change while I am going through a package?",
  "a16": "Darsoon reserves the right to change the price of the lessons. However, after you pay for a multi-session package, if the price changes, it will not have any impact on the price of the sessions that have been already paid by you."
